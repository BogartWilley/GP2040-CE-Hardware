## Summary

This is a 4040 profile mount system for the new Logitech G PRO RS wheel hubs.  

While some inspiration was taken from various paid models that I saw online, all measurements were taken by myself and the 3D models created from scratch in Fusion360.

Included with this is both a blank center cap and one with the Logitech ‘G’ logo.

Included are models for M4, M6 and M8 mounting to profiles based on the parts you have.

The center cap is not needed and only there for vanity.

A full set of printing STLs, 3MFs as well as source STEP files are provided with this.

To assemble the `Logitech G PRO RS Wheel Hub 4040 mount` it is also recommended to have:
- 1x M4 18mm countersunk bolt
- 1x M4 flange nut


## Printing tips

Print with 6x walls to ensure solid sides.

I printed this originally on my Bambu X1C with matte black PLA.
