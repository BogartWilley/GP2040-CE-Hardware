## Summary

This is a wall mount system for the new Logitech G PRO RS wheel hubs.  

While some inspiration was taken from various paid models that I saw online, all measurements were taken by myself and the 3D models created from scratch in Fusion360.

Included with this is both a blank center cap and one with the Logitech ‘G’ logo.

The center cap is not needed and only there for vanity.

A full set of printing STLs, 3MFs as well as source STEP files are provided with this.

To assemble the `Logitech G PRO RS Wheel Hub wall mount` it is also recommended to have:
- 1x M4 18mm countersunk bolt
- 1x M4 flange nut


## Printing tips

Print with 6x walls to ensure solid sides.

I printed this originally on my Bambu X1C with matte black PLA.
