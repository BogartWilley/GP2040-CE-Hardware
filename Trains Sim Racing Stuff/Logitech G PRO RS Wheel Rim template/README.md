## Summary

The Logitech G PRO RS Wheel Rim template project is designed to offer an open source template for makers to encourage more wheel rims into the market that are compatible with the Logitech G PRO RS Wheel Hub.

The `Logitech G PRO RS Wheel Rim template` files were measured manually against my Logitech RS Round Wheel and verified to fit my Logitech G PRO RS Wheel Hub (Xbox version).

The `Logitech G PRO RS Wheel Rim template - Full` adds to the above template and has cut out sections for the top LED bar and buttons as well as the left and right rotary encoders.  It has also been verified to fit my Logitech G PRO RS Wheel Hub (Xbox version).

!!! Please note that I have yet to get either of these files cut on metal.  Proceed with caution!  I am not responcible for cuts that do not fit !!!
