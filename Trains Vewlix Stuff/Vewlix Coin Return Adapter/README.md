## Summary

This is a very simple mod for your Vewlix / Chewlix unit.  My Chewlix (and others that I have seen) do not come with a spring for the coin return button.  While some of the coin units have a built in return mech that will allow the button to work, if you are making a custom solution this will just float.

The Vewlix coin return adapter lets you put a standard JLF spring (or JLF type spring) in to allow the coin return button to spring return.  


## Printing tips

Print multiple outside walls as well as multiple top and bottom layers so that this prints at 100% infill.  It is a very small part but prints quickly and will be strong.  

I printed this originally on my Bambu X1C with matte black PLA.
