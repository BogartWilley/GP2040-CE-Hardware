## Summary

This will likely be a very niche thing but if you need it I hope you like it.  These are adapter rings so that your SiTong buttons are not loose on Vewlix panels (real and reproduction).


## Printing tips

Print multiple outside walls as well as multiple top and bottom layers so that this prints at 100% infill.  It is a very small part but prints quickly and will be strong.  

I printed this originally on my Bambu X1C with matte black PLA.
