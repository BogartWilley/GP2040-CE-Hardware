## Summary

This is a collection of stickers for Vewlix and Chewlix arcade machines.  It is designed to offer high quality and, in come cases, custom designs to add to your arcade.

## Coin Label - Custom Black

![Coin Label - Custom Black](/Coin%20Label%20-%20Custom%20Black/Black%20-%20100y.png)

The Coin Label is based on the original design from user `Huey Le`.  I will update the original work when I finish getting the rest of the stickers done.

This is my custom black version of the coin label.

Files are as follows:
- `Coin Label - Custom Black - 100y - Cut file.afdesign` - Working file for the cut lines on the 100y sticker in Affinity Designer 2 format
- `Coin Label - Custom Black - 100y - Cut file.svg` - Cut file for the sticker set (sized at 100mm x 72mm)
- `Coin Label - Custom Black - 100y.afdesign` - Original working file for the single 100y sticker in Affinity Designer 2 format

To cut these on a plot cutter like the Cricut:
1 - Import the `Coin Label - Custom Black - 100y.png` file and size to 100mm x 72mm, placing at a static position on the workspace
2 - Import the `Coin Label - Custom Black - 100y - Cut file.svg` file and size to 100mm x 72mm, placing at the same static position on the workspace as the art file
3 - Attach both files
4 - Print and then cut

It is recommended to use Cricut brand white sticker paper (with laminate overlay).
