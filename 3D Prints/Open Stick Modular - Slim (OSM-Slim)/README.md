- I am not responsible for any damage that happens to your printer or parts of your printer as a result of printing these files.

## Summary:

The Open Stick Modular - Slim (OSM-Slim) is a new entry in the growing OSM linup.  

The OSM-Slim focuses on offering a lower proile design for those that do not need to hold a stick inside.

Although the top plates are 170mm x 160mm, the front and back mid-frame parts take up the entire 256mm x 256mm bed when printed so you will need a printer with a minimum of 256mm x 256mm to print this case. 

The total size of the OSM-Slim is about 340mm x 160mm.

The OSM-Slim is designed to be hand soldered and can take most low profile switches, but mainly designed for Red Dragon low profile switches (other switches may be loose).  It is also designed to take the newer RP2040 SuperMini board.  

The large button holes are 30.05mm.

The small button holes are 24.05mm.

The aux button holes are 22.05mm.

The caps shown in the cover image will be uploaded at a later time.

## Printing and Construction:

This project is now complete and I have printed and checked the final version of each file.  If there are improvements made and those files will be posted when I make them.

Please note that I am not taking on requests for other layouts at this time.  The STLs and STEP files have been posted so you can be easily edited in TinkerCAD or Fusion360 (or the program of your choice).

This case was printed on a Bambu Labs X1C and P1S printer with the following changes to settings:
- 0.08mm layer height
- 4 outer walls (Bambu Lab - 3 Wall loops)
- 10 top layers
- 10 bottom layers
- Hex infill
- 15% infill

Please note that supports are needed for the printing of this case on the top left and right plates.  The supports have been added into the included .3MF file.

Based on my prints the entire case takes around 550 grams of filament so you should be able to easily get a cases out of a single 1kg roll.

This case was printed using Bambu Labs matte PLA filament, I have not tested it with other filaments.

Each piece should be placed flat down on the print bed to ensure maximum strength. 

The front and back main frame parts need to be printed at a 45 on the print bed to fit.  

The following hardware is needed to assemble the case:
- 8 x M4 16mm brass standoffs (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003662327137.html)
- 16 x M4 12mm countersunk hex bolts (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001072025844.html)
- 1 x RP2040 SuperMini (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007385048661.html)


Assembly:
- The M4 12mm brass standoffs slide into the four corner posts and should be friction fit.  They will be tight.
- The top and bottom plates are secured with four (each) M4 12mm countersunk bolts.
- The RP2040 SuperMini fits in via friction.  You may need a drop of hot glue once soldered.
