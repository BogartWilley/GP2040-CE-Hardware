## Donations and Support

These files are not posted with the intention of making money.  If you enjoy them and want to toss me a few bucks it will go toward filament and parts that will be used to make more cool stuff that gets posted.  

All donations or tips will be split evenly between myself and [Dash n'Mash](https://twitter.com/Dash_xx_Mash?s=20).
